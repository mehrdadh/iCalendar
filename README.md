## Installation

### Option 1: Install from Chrome Web Store (Recommended)

Install the extension directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/icalendar/dbbbojhlacnjcejnlfhbignjignbpgfd).

The extension is ready to use out of the box with pre-configured OAuth credentials!

### Option 2: Development Installation (Load Unpacked)

For developers or those who want to customize the extension:

#### Step 1: Install the Extension

No hard-coded credentials required! Each user brings their own OAuth credentials.

2. Enable **"Developer mode"** (toggle in top right)
3. Click **"Load unpacked"**
4. Select the extension directory
5. Copy the **Extension ID** (you'll need it for OAuth setup)

#### Step 3: Set Up Your Google OAuth (5 minutes)

See [USER_SETUP_GUIDE.md](./scripts/USER_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

**Quick steps:**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create project and enable Calendar API
3. Set up OAuth consent screen
4. Create OAuth Client ID (type: Web application)
5. Copy your Client ID

#### Step 4: Configure the Extension

1. Open `popup.js` in your code editor
2. Find line ~16: `const GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = '...'`
3. Replace with your Client ID
4. Save the file
5. Reload the extension in Chrome

## Usage

1. Click the extension icon - **You'll be prompted to authorize on first use**
2. Sign in with Google and grant calendar permissions
3. Your calendars will load automatically
4. Drag and drop an `.ics` or `.vcs` file (or click to browse)
5. Review the event details (title, time, location)
6. Select which calendar to add the event to
7. Click **"Add to Calendar"**
8. Event created! ✓ (Display auto-clears after 2.5 seconds)

## How It Works

1. **First-Time Setup**: On first use, you'll be prompted to authorize with Google Calendar
2. **Calendar Loading**: Your Google Calendars load automatically and are cached for quick access
3. **File Validation**: Drag and drop validates `.ics` or `.vcs` file extension
4. **Calendar File Parsing**:
   - Auto-detects iCalendar 2.0 (.ics) or vCalendar 1.0 (.vcs) format
   - Handles line folding per RFC 5545 and vCalendar specs
   - Decodes escape sequences (`\n` → newlines, etc.)
   - Extracts key event data
5. **Smart Display**: Shows only essential info (event title as heading, start/end times, location)
6. **Calendar Selection**: Choose which Google Calendar to add the event to
7. **Smart Authentication**: OAuth tokens are cached in persistent storage with silent refresh
   - Tokens stored in encrypted `chrome.storage.local`
   - 5-minute expiry buffer for smooth UX
   - Silent authentication (no popup!) when token expires
   - Interactive popup only shown when absolutely necessary
8. **Event Creation**: Converts calendar data to Google Calendar API format and creates the event
9. **Auto-Clear**: Success message shows for 2 seconds, then fades out with event data cleared

### Feature Flags

Event caching can be toggled in `popup.js`:

```javascript
const ENABLE_EVENT_CACHING = false; // Set to true to persist events across sessions
```

All file processing happens locally in your browser. The extension only communicates with Google Calendar API when
loading calendars or creating events.

## What Gets Created in Google Calendar

The extension extracts and creates events with the following information from your ICS file:

- **Event Title** (SUMMARY)
- **Start Date/Time** (DTSTART)
- **End Date/Time** (DTEND)
- **Location** (LOCATION)
- **Description** (DESCRIPTION)
- **Attendees** (ATTENDEE) - if present
- **Recurrence Rules** (RRULE) - if present

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (Manifest V3)
- Edge (Chromium-based)
- Other Chromium-based browsers

## Troubleshooting

### "Unsupported file type" error

- Make sure your file has the `.ics` or `.vcs` extension
- Verify the file is a valid iCalendar or vCalendar file

### "Failed to create event" error

- Check that you've completed the Google Calendar API setup
- Verify your Client ID is correct in `popup.js` (line ~16)
- Make sure you're added as a test user in Google Cloud Console
- Ensure Calendar API is enabled in your Google Cloud project
- Try reloading the extension

### No calendars showing

- Check browser console for errors (Right-click popup → Inspect → Console)
- Verify you granted calendar.readonly permission
- Reload the extension and reauthorize

### OAuth/Authentication errors

- See [USER_SETUP_GUIDE.md](./scripts/USER_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for setup instructions
- See [TOKEN_CACHING_INFO.md](./scripts/TOKEN_CACHING_INFO.md) for token behavior

### Event not persisting after closing popup

- This is expected behavior with `ENABLE_EVENT_CACHING = false`
- Set flag to `true` in `popup.js` to enable persistence

## Privacy & Security

- Files are processed locally in your browser
- No data is sent to any server except Google Calendar API
- OAuth tokens are cached in encrypted Chrome storage (persists across service worker restarts)
- Tokens automatically expire after 1 hour
- The extension requests two permissions:
  - `calendar.events` - Create calendar events
  - `calendar.readonly` - Read your calendar list
- You can revoke access anytime in your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
- Event caching is disabled by default (no data persists after popup closes)
