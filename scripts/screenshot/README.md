# Screenshot Helper

Interactive screenshot tool for capturing high-quality screenshots of the iCalendar extension popup.

## Running the Server

You need to run a local web server because the tool uses `fetch()` to load files.

### Option 1: Python (Recommended)

From the project root directory:

```bash
cd /Users/mhessar/work/chrome_extension
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open: <http://localhost:8000/scripts/screenshot/screenshot-helper.html>

### Option 2: Node.js

```bash
npx serve
```

Then navigate to the screenshot helper in your browser.

### Option 3: VS Code Live Server

1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click `screenshot-helper.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"
